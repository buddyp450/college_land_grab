# Acquisitions and Leasing of Properties by Colleges

The goal of this project is to create and use a data set of properties bought or leased by local college institutions in order to determine civic impact.

## To do:

### 1) Create data set to be ingested

I've been pulling the data from [the uncg web portal](http://search.uncg.edu/search?q=annual+report+property+purchased+or+leased&btnG=Search&site=default_collection&client=default_frontend&output=xml_no_dtd&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&sort=date%3AD%3AL%3Ad1&entsp=a&wc=200&wc_mc=1&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&ud=1&exclude_apps=1#), better sources encouraged.

This involves updating the google spreadsheet located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3y7VtEDA56sIGrwzUaR2T01vXuYccNHjIzBVob9ScQ/edit?usp=sharing) with all publicly available information as far as what is presented in the annual reports.

Currently I've been using the annual reports from the nearby college of UNCG. These documents are somewhat difficult to locate and change format at some point so I'm cataloging everything into the google spreadsheet.

Attached are the documents I've been pulling from but feel free to commit any new ones you may find. I'm not opposed to any changes in the tables or data structures. Consider everything an open sandbox.

### 2) Ingest Data into postgres

TBD, if looking for a great primer on postgres be sure to check out the [data-class](https://github.com/codeforgso/data-class/wiki) by Brendan Younger.

### 3) Story-board some use-cases for the data

Ideas encouraged. buddyp450@gmail.com
